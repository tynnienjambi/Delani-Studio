 ## Behavior Driven Development
 1. Under what we do, clicking on the image will toggle a paragraph explaining about the service.
 2. Hovering over each image will show a white box with the name of the image.
 3. Upon entering your details and message in the contact-us form, the data will be sent to mailchimp and you will receive a confirmation message thanking you for contacting them.
 4. In case, submit form is entered without any values in the form, an alert message will pop-up telling you to put in valid information.
